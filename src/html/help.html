<p>Thank you for registering with 
<a href="http://www.crewtimer.com" target="_top">www.crewtimer.com</a>.&nbsp; Your account is now enabled for access to create 
your regattas and link your mobile device.&nbsp; To get started simply enter your registered email address 
in the login box and log in.</p>
<strong><em>Creating Your Regatta</em></strong><p>Once you log in you'll see a new link on the bottom left of your screen 
labeled '<strong><em>My Regattas</em></strong>'.&nbsp; This is where you'll go 
to configure your regattas.&nbsp; To configure a new regatta, click on<strong><em> 
'My Regattas'</em></strong> and then <strong>'Add New Event'.</strong>&nbsp; 
You'll then have an opportunity to set your desired Regatta Name, Date, and 
other fields.</p>
<strong><em>Creating Your Spreadsheet</em></strong><p>Your most important entry will be the <strong><em>Google Doc URL</em></strong>.&nbsp; 
This is a link to your online spreadsheet using Google Sheets.&nbsp; The best 
way to get started is to start from a copy of two example spreadsheets:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rKtt6x9Cw_Dwnbhej7rvyqP14bDF4myI3sMBmlYZMSQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CrewTimer example Sprint race</a></li>
	<li>
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K2UWYS9Vfb4HlHtMGRi5pGRWj4CM9ZrKNbWo58vdvh4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CrewTimer example Head race</a> 
	(this form can also be used for Sprint races)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you open one of these spreadsheets, select File/Make a Copy to start 
your own spreadsheet.&nbsp; Delete or change rows to suit your needs.&nbsp; 
Additional columns are OK and are ignored by CrewTimer.</p>
<p>If you have an Excel spreadsheet you can import this into Google Sheets and 
start from that as well.&nbsp; The column headings should match the headers in 
the example sheet: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Sprint: Event #, Event Time, Event Name, Lane 1, Lane X</li>
	<li>Head: Event Time,Flight,Event #,Event,Event Abbrev,<br />
	Crew,Crew 
	Abbrev,Bow #,Age</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a requirement to use a different header name for spreadsheet 
columns please let CrewTimer know as some header aliases are allowed.&nbsp; e.g. 
'Start' for 'Event Time' or 'Event No.' for 'Event #', etc.&nbsp; As noted 
below, the download format from Regatta Central is also supported.</p>
<strong><em>Connecting your Spreadsheet</em></strong><p>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none;">
To connect your Google Sheet to CrewTimer, a share link is copied from your 
spreadsheet and pasted into your regatta configuration.&nbsp; To make the spreadsheet 
available to CrewTimer select<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;the Share 
icon in the upper right, then select Get Sharable Link, then select 'Anyone with 
the link can view'</span>.&nbsp; Copy the share URL and paste into your regatta 
configuration page as your Google Doc URL.&nbsp; This url is a private URL known 
only to you and CrewTimer.&nbsp; It does not give CrewTimer permission to modify 
your spreadsheet.</span></p>
<p>Once you have entered your Google Doc URL click on the '<em>Load 
Spreadsheet'</em> button on the <em>My Regattas</em> page.</p>
<p>Validate your setup by clicking on the CrewTimer logo in 
the upper left and selecting View Results for your regatta.</p><strong><em>Configuring the CrewTimer mobile app</em></strong><em></span></em><p>
If you haven't done so already, download the CrewTimer app from the Play Store 
by searching for CrewTimer or use this link: 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.entazza.crewtimer" target="_blank">
<br />
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.entazza.crewtimer</a></p>
<p>Once you have the CrewTimer app loaded you'll need to enable the 
CrewTimer.com integration features:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select Settings Menu and check the Enable&nbsp;
	<a href="http://www.CrewTimer.com" target="_top">www.CrewTimer.com</a> integration option.</li>
	<li>Enter the Event Code shown on your My Regattas page.</li>
	<li>Enter the Event PIN shown on your My Regattas page.</li>
	<li>Exit Settings</li>
</ol>
<p>The mobile app will contact <a href="http://www.CrewTimer.com" target="_top">www.CrewTimer.com</a> and download the configuration of your regatta.&nbsp; If 
you made a mistake on the Event Code or PIN, go back to settings and correct it.&nbsp; 
If your regatta configuration does now show up, try exiting the app and 
restarting it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other</em></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the Clear Race Data link to restart your regatta timing data from 
	scratch.&nbsp; Use this if you tested your mobile devices before the regatta 
	and need to erase any time events.</li>
	<li>Check the 'Public Visible' option to make your regatta visible to anyone 
	on the Internet.&nbsp; Without this checked, only you can see the results.</li>
	<li>Users viewing the results from the Internet will only see results 
	updated once a minute.&nbsp; Click your browser refresh to see results 
	sooner.</li>
	<li>An Edit Results link will be visible.&nbsp; This is an experimental 
	feature and should only be used at the direction of a CrewTimer support 
	contact.</li>
	<li>PDF results are available for printing or archive by using the Chrome 
	browser and selecting the Print icon.&nbsp; From there select Save as PDF or 
	Save to Google Drive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Twitter Integration</em></strong></p>
<p>If you wish CrewTimer to post to your twitter feed when races are delcared 
official, you can enable twitter integration on your regatta configuration page.&nbsp; 
When you click 'Authorize Twitter' you will be taken to a twitter page to give 
permission for CrewTimer to post on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regatta Central download</em></strong></p>
<p>CrewTimer supports the spreadsheet format produced by the generic spreadsheet 
downloaded from Regatta Central as boats.xls.&nbsp; To integrate this 
spreadsheet with CrewTimer, follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Download your boats.xls file.</li>
	<li>Import boats.xls into Google Drive</li>
	<li>Right click on boats.xls and select 'Open with Sheets'.&nbsp; This will 
	convert it into a Google Sheets spreadsheet instead of an excel spreadsheet.</li>
	<li>Edit your spreadsheet as desired and add bow numbers for all your 
	entries.&nbsp; If a bow number is not specified, CrewTimer will choose a 
	number starting at 400 as a temporary number.</li>
	<li>Share your document as described above and paste the sharing url into 
	CrewTimer.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you download the RegattaMaster spreadsheet instead of the Generic form 
from RegattaCentral it will work as long as you insure the 'boats' sheet is 
first in the list of sheets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Masters Handicaps</em></strong></p>
<p>CrewTimer supports three Masters Handicap types as selected on the regatta 
configuration page:</p>
<ol>
	<li>None - No handicap is applied for any entries.</li>
	<li>Manual - A column labeled handicap is applied to entries that also have 
	an age specified.&nbsp; The handicap is specified in seconds as a positive 
	number that will be subtracted from the elapsed time of the entry.</li>
	<li>US - Handicaps will be applied to all entries that specify and age &gt;= 27 
	using the formula specified by USRowing.&nbsp; Entries with an age less than 
	27 will not have a handicap applied.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need a different handicap system applied, please contact CrewTimer 
with the details of your handicap system.</p>
<p><strong><em>FAQ</em></strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>What is the '?' button for on CrewTimer mobile?&nbsp; The question mark 
	is for cases where you can't determine the bow number immediately but need 
	to record one or more time events.&nbsp; Once you press '?' a time event is 
	recorded and you can subsequently edit the bow number for the time event by 
	touching it.</li>
	<li>Can I hook up an external button for timing events?&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, you 
	can hook up an external button to assist with recording timing events.&nbsp; 
	When an external button is used, the timing events are recorded on the 
	button press and pressing bow numbers on the mobile device will match up to 
	the recorded time events.&nbsp; This is particularly helpful for close 
	finishes.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the external button, you can use a standard phone 
	earbud with a microphone as used for handsfree operation as long as your 
	handsfree device has a button on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; A more ergonomic plunger 
	style button switch is available from CrewTimer for $25.</li>
	<li>What if I accidently record an event?&nbsp;&nbsp; Just tap the red X 
	delete icon and mark the event as deleted.&nbsp; Any event recorded by 
	CrewTimer can be deleted in this manner.&nbsp; Deleted events can also be 
	restored.</li>
	<li>How do I assess a penalty?&nbsp; Press and hold the bow number and 
	select from either a standard penalty or a custom penalty used by your 
	regatta.</li>
	<li>What if a boat does not finish or start?&nbsp;&nbsp; You can press and 
	hold the bow number to bring up a Penalty/Status form for that boat.&nbsp; 
	In this form you can mark the boat as DNS or DNF.</li>
	<li>What is the 'Official' button shown for each event used for?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	This will change the online results page for the event from 'Provisional' to 
	'Official'.&nbsp; If you have twitter integration it will also tweet a 
	result message for the event.&nbsp; If you accidently mark an event 
	Official, you have one minute to mark it as deleted to avoid sending a 
	tweet.&nbsp; In other words, a tweet is not sent for one minute after you 
	mark an event Official.</li>
	<li>What do the background colors of the timestamp mean?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Yellow/Orange indicates that the timing event has not been communicated to 
	the CrewTimer cloud server.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue indicates the timestamp has 
	been recorded in the cloud.&nbsp; A red indicator means that there is a 
	communication problem to the cloud, most likely due to poor 3G coverage.&nbsp; 
	This will automatically correct itself when communication is restored.&nbsp; 
	In any case.&nbsp; all timing events are stored in persistent storage in the 
	mobile device and will be communicated to the cloud server as soon as 
	possible.</li>
	<li>What happens if I exit the app?&nbsp; If you exit the app, all timing 
	events are retained.&nbsp; When the app restarts, any pending timing events 
	will be communicated to the cloud server.</li>
	<li>Can I modify the spreadsheet after a regatta starts?&nbsp; Yes, you can 
	add entries, delete entries, and make any changes you like.&nbsp; However, 
	any entries for which there is already a time event recorded will be 
	retained regardless of changes you make to the spreadsheet.&nbsp;&nbsp; When 
	you change the spreadsheet, CrewTimer will not update until you click the 
	'Load Spreadsheet' button.&nbsp; Any connected mobile devices are also 
	notified of the lineup change and the mobile UI will update as will any 
	connected web clients viewing www.crewtimer.com.</li>
